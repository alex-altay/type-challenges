# Collection of my solutions to Type Challenges

I beginned to solve the challenges just for fun, one/two/three (okay, who am I kidding, sometimes 5 and more) per evening after the dinner. It's completely useless in practical terms but they help to understand type system on deeper level - you cannot say that you master something, unless you know its limitation and these challenges show TS limits really well<br/>
